- 👋 Hi, I’m @pkivolowitz
- 👀 I’m interested in code quality, CS education, OS and assembly language
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how much fun it is to write a text book
- 💞️ I’m looking to consult on code reviews - I WILL find bugs!
- 📫 How to reach me ...via github

I will be retiring to the Mobile Alabama area. I would welcome part-time consulting opportunities to perform code reviews within the many major 
industrial concerns in the area.

Please see Amazon for Get Off My L@wn, a zombie apocalypse novel where the main character flexes his leet coding skills to destroy zombie hordes.
